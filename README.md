# Custom starter template to build HTML emails 

This is a customized starter template to build responsive HTML emails.
It is based on Foundation for Emails framework but I added some features like Vertical Rhythm.

Just run npm install on the root folder and you'll be ready to start

To customize the styles you can use the template settings file found on: 

src/assets/scss/template/template-settings.scss

Also feel free to change the other scss files to make it work for you.
